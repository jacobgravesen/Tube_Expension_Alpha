# Tube Expansion

The project uses computervision to locate the center points of holes in a tube plate, meant for being applied to tube expansion for boilers.
Below are GIFs explaining the basics of the program. The GIFs are from an outdated video and only meant to illustrate the basic principle. 
They should be updated to reflect the new system soon.

## Move the Robot Base to the Tube Plate
The user will take the robot base on wheels and roll it in close proximity to the tube plate.

## Use the GUI to Save the Points
The user will then use the GUI to select what the Robot should do:
- Save the predicted 3D points from the vision system
- Move the robot to those points
- Return to home position
